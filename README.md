# 📋 Taskly

Taskly is a smart Flutter-powered task and note management app inspired by proven productivity techniques. Organize your tasks based on urgency and importance with a clean, minimal UI that adapts to your workflow.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

Taskly leverages the **Eisenhower Matrix** method to help you manage tasks effectively. Prioritize what matters most by sorting tasks into four actionable categories. Quickly add, edit, delete, and search notes or tasks with ease in a dark-themed interface.

* **Urgent & Important**
* **Urgent but Not Important**
* **Not Urgent but Important**
* **Not Urgent & Not Important**

📝 Notes Management:

* Create and edit notes
* Categorize by type (General, Personal, Work, Ideas, Creativity)
* Text formatting: **bold**, *italic*, *underline*

🔍 Powerful Search:

* Search tasks or notes by title/content
* Filter by category

🗑️ Easy Deletion:

🌙 Dark Mode:

## 🏗️ Code Structure & Design Pattern

The app follows a modular and scalable folder structure:

```
lib/
 ├── main.dart              # App entry point
assets/
 └── images/                # UI images and icons
```

> *Planned improvements include RiverPod, sqflite for persistent storage, and uuid for ID generation.*
