Taskly is a smart Flutter-powered task and note management app inspired by proven productivity techniques. Organize your tasks based on urgency and importance with a clean, minimal UI that adapts to your workflow.

## 🏗️ Code Structure & Design Pattern

The app follows a modular and scalable folder structure:

```
lib/
 ├── main.dart              # App entry point
 ├── models/                # Task and Note data models
 ├── provider/              # (Optional) State management with Riverpod
 ├── screen/                # UI Screens
 │    ├── home_screen.dart
 │    ├── add_task_screen.dart
 │    ├── task_detail.dart
 └── widget/                # Reusable UI components
      ├── task_card.dart
      ├── note_card.dart
assets/
 └── images/                # UI images and icons
```

> *Planned improvements include RiverPod, sqflite for persistent storage, and uuid for ID generation.*
